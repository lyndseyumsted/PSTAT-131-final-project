# PSTAT 131 Using Machine Learning to Predict Covid-19 Risk in California Communities

## Project Description

This project is intended to build and deploy a machine learning classification model which categorizes California zip codes into low, moderate, or high risk for Covid-19 outbreaks by the end of the year of 2020. Risk predictions of Covid-19 were made using 21 different predictors including socioeconomic, health, abiotic, and pollution indicators. The intention of this project is to identify the underlying correlations for communities with high rates of Covid-19 cases cumulatively by the end of the year 2020. All models were implemented using a Tidymodels implementation using the R programming language.

This project originates from a personal interest in public health and previous studying done on disease dynamics. The machine learning power of these models have the ability to identify underlying correlations between variables very quickly and build predictions upon observations providing much information about communities most heavily affected by this disease.

## Necessary Installations

This project is run entirely in RStudio so an updated version of R needs to be installed
